Imagine you have a toy car (your trading strategy) and you want to know if it's good before buying a real car. A backtest is like playing with your toy car on a pretend road (past market data) to see how well it drives.
But many toy roads are too smooth and perfect - no bumps, no traffic, no waiting at gas stations. This gives you the wrong idea about how your car will work in the real world.

REALBT makes the toy road much more like a real road - with bumps (price slippage), traffic (market impact), and gas stations (transaction costs). This way, when your toy car does well, you can be more confident your real car (actual trading strategy) will also do well.
